## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Major learnings:

Learned about input event listener, which updates the html/output as you input in th input box 

Checking many validation errors, althought I think there might be some short code or short way to check the validation, as i carried out individual validation checks, with respective alert messages and css updates.

Media query can be applied only after the respective normal styles, then only it will work



### Useful resources

AI (ChatGPT) was really helpful, when I got stuck somewhere.
